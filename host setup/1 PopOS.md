# Reference and Notes

<https://system76.com/pop>

Install similar to Ubuntu. Items of note:

- For home server, do not select encrypt disk - requires password with each restart.
- DO NOT install the AMD GPU drivers, just use what comes with the OS - GPU drivers don't work. 
- Samba sharing through GUI doesn't work. Requires installing nautilus-share but still is ineffective because nothing is written to /etc/samba/smb.conf. Best to set up shares manually.
- ~~Don't connect to WiFi unless necessary. There seems to be an issue with the driver where it randomly failed under vanilla Ubuntu and prevented booting under Pop!_OS after many restarts (unexpected!!!)~~ Jan 2020: WiFi is enabled and connected to guest network, appears to be stable.
- Minimize window isnâ€™t enabled by default. Use Gnome Tweaks.
